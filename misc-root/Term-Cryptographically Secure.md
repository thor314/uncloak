# Term-Cryptographically Secure
A cryptosystem is typically said to be cryptographically secure if there exists a mathematical security reduction from the security assumptions of the system to some intractable (typically NP-hard) problem. The term is interchangeable with "information-theoretically secure". While cryptographic algorithms may be cryptographically secure, it is technically an abuse of the term to describe software systems as cryptographically secure. The underlying algorithms may be secure, but this implies nothing about the security of the software implementation.
