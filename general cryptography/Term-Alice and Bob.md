# Term-Alice and Bob
Alice and Bob are commonly used stand-in parties for describing cryptographic systems, and more generally, any protocol involving at least two parties. They were introduced to the world by the 1978 paper "A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-key Cryptosystems"[^1], by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adlemen, now famous for introducing the [[Encryption Scheme-RSA|RSA encryption system]]. Other common characters include Eve the eavesdropper, Mallory the malicious actor, Peggy the prover and Victor the verifier in zero knowledge, and beyond.
