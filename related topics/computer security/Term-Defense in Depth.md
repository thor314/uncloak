# Term-Defense in Depth
In security, a system with defense is a system that requires an attacker to break through several layers of security measures before the system is compromised. Examples include doubly-encrypting messages in different cryptosystems, routing packages through many [[Term-Onion Layer|onion layers]] in a mixnet, or using [[Topic-Secure Enclave|secure enclaves]] to perform private computation on a machine with other security  security measures.

```
*an attacker must break components A, B, and C to compromise the system. This is defense in depth.*

```mermaid

A(security layer A) -.secures.-> D(assets)
B(security layer B) -.secures.-> D
C(security layer C) -.secures.-> D
```
*An attacker may break any component, A, B, or C to compromise the system. This is the opposite of defense in depth.*
