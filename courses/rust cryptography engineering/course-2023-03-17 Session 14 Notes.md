## Discussion
This week will cover ZK at a high level, specifically ZK circuits and emerging applications. We will specifically cover Schnorr's $\Sigma$ protocol for proof of knowledge of Exponent. ZK is a large topic, the interested reader is directed to the [Moon Math Manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeastAuthority/moonmath-manual/main/main-moonmath.pdf) and [Proofs, Arguments, and Zero Knowledge](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf).
