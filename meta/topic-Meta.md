# topic-Meta
The Meta area is for site discussion and documentation. 

Contributors should start with the [[meta-Uncloak Contributor Guide]]. Ask questions in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h). 

### Notes on site maintenance:
Note that the site is limited to 4GB of image content. Take advantage of native markdown features like LaTeX and [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) to create pages with rich examples in preference to including images, though you may include images if the situation justifies. If you would like to include an image from a tool that is not yet supported by the site (eg. Tikz), take a screenshot of the output, and include the code for the image in a footnote.

Changes to this git repository do not automatically push to the site. This has to be done manually, until we get around to automating it.
