# Reference: Node Categorization
*this note gives a [reference](https://documentation.divio.com/reference/) to the node categorization system, as applied in cryptography. [[Explanation-Node Categorization|See explanation instead]]. Terms used here are still evolving, and may change. Last updated 2022-11-04, this note is rapidly changing*.

What follows is an enumeration of the different node categories and subcategories, and expected content within. The categorization system presented is specialized for cryptography.

## Things to address:
- How this node differs for All/Developer/Researcher Audiences
- What sections should all nodes of this category have?

## Statement

## Object Types
Likely sections:
- Intro
    - Visual object model (mermaid)
    - date introduced, with source; and if applicable, date broken/deprecated with source
    - Key definitions, informally stated
- Relation to similar objects
- Attacks
- Related Links 
    - Highlighted best pedagogical link
    - Abstractions over this object
    - Ancestors and successors to this object
- In depth (bifurcate out researcher and developer nodes if exceeding 500 words):
    - historical information
    - researcher-directed content
        - formal definitions
        - relevant theorems
        - security model
        - conjecture and discussion
    - developer directed content
        - common APIs
        - libraries
        - implementation details
- References
