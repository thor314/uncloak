# Topic-Cryptography
**Cryptography** (also cryptology) is the practice and study of [[Term-Cryptographically Secure|secure]] techniques for communication, [[Term-Authentication|authentication]], and computation in the presence of a malicious or interfering [[Term-Adversary, Security Model|adversary]]. [[Term-Cryptographer|Cryptographers]] and [[Term-Cryptography Engineer|cryptography engineers]] draw on techniques from a wide range of fields (mathematics, information theory, computer science, electrical engineering, distributed systems, physics, and beyond) to construct protocols.

## History
The word cryptography comes from the Greek root words *kryptos*, meaning hidden, and *graphikos*, meaning writing. Prior to 1976, cryptography was limited to the study of [[Topic-Symmetric Encryption]] techniques: techniques for encrypting from [[Term-Plaintext and Ciphertext|unhidden plaintext to inscrutible ciphertext]], and decrypting ciphertext to plaintext.
